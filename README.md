# Application of modern coexistence theory to rare plant restoration 

We use a long-term monitoring data of Lasthenia conjugens from a restoration project in California vernal pools 
Data is publically available via Environmental Data Initiative at:  https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/1daedb3a3b601d0fd9ccb4120cfb504e

First, run "compile composition"" to load data. Then, run "prep data before modeling" to clean data.

Second, run "Constructed pools model" and "Reference pools model" to model population dynamics of Lasthenia conjugens over time. 

Third, run "Invasion analysis" for calculating growth rate when rare and partitioning of persistence mechanisms.

Lastly, run "Exotic grass simulation" to simulate exotic grass reduction as a management tool.
